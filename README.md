# math-tables

This project has AdditionTable.java and MultiplicationTable.java. Both are very similar programs, only difference is that one does addition and the other does multiplication. The project utilizes Scanner, to grab user input, and 2D arrays to make a table. The user inputs two lists of numbers (int), and the program uses the two lists to add or multiply the numbers of the lists to each other.
